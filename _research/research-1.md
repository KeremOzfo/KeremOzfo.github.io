In this work, we make a trough investigation on why State-of-the-art Byzantine attacks work and the vulnerablities of current aggregation methods. We propose a 
novel aggregation method that is robust to Byzantine attacks. We show that our method is robust to Byzantine attacks and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in the presence of Byzantine attacks.
We propose Sequantial clipping method that utilize randomness to prevent Maliocus clients from manipulating the aggregation results. We show that our method is robust to Byzantine attacks and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in the presence of Byzantine attacks.
